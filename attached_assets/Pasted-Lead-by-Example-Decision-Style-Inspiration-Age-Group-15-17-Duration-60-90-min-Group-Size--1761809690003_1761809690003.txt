Peula Components:

Peula Component | Description & Guidelines | Tzofim Best Practices & Time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic & Educational Goal

Description & Guidelines:
Focus: Leadership and taking responsibility for self and group. Participants explore four leadership styles (Directive, Participative/Democratic, Coaching/Servant, Delegative), practice decision-making under constraints, and learn how to inspire and guide others.
Learning outcomes by the end of the peula:
- Identify strengths and trade-offs of different leadership styles.
- Rotate leadership roles and practice making clear, timely decisions.
- Use motivational language and vision-setting to inspire peers.
Success indicators:
- Each participant leads at least once.
- Group completes at least one collaborative challenge using an agreed decision process.
- Each participant writes a personal leadership commitment they can act on this week.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Ground the topic in real Tzofim values: Dugma Ishit (lead by example), Areivut (mutual responsibility), Learning by doing. Make learning experiential: short theory, mostly action. Use concrete roles (leader, timekeeper, safety spotter, observer). Encourage shared leadership—rotate quickly so everyone practices.

Time Structure:
Integrated into Opening Circle: 0:00–0:05 for framing and goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Know Your Audience

Description & Guidelines:
Age 15–17: ready for autonomy, critical thinking, and real responsibility. Group size 5–10: small enough for rotating leadership and fast feedback.
Differentiation and inclusion ("fits everyone"):
- Offer alternative roles in physical tasks (strategist, communicator, observer) so participants with different abilities can fully participate.
- Use clear visual station signs; avoid jargon; demonstrate each task.
- Allow different ways to lead (speaking, organizing materials, modeling calm).
- Check comfort levels before rope activity; adjust difficulty to group capacity.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Set norms collaboratively: listening, no put-downs, take care of each other. Invite youth voice—ask what leadership looks like in their tribe/class. Ensure balanced participation; if someone leads often, invite them to coach peers. Use small groups for safety and voice.

Time Structure:
Quick audience scan and role matching during Opening: 0:05–0:07 (within the 0:00–0:10 segment). Ongoing micro-check-ins during transitions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Choose Methods & Activities

Description & Guidelines:
Methods selected to match goals:
- Energizer with rotating leaders to feel immediate impact of style.
- Leadership Style Stations to experience and compare styles.
- Rope decision-making challenge to practice structured decisions under constraints.
- Inspire-others role-play plus crafting a commitment flag to translate learning into action.
These combine movement, collaboration, reflection, and creation, aligned with Tzofim experiential education.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Use short action cycles (5–10 minutes) followed by quick debriefs. Keep roles visible (lanyards or stickers for leader/timekeeper/observer). Link every activity to a leadership principle. End with tangible artifact (commitment flag) to carry forward.

Time Structure:
Activities mapped to the Flow: Energizer 0:10–0:20; Stations 0:20–0:40; Rope challenge 0:40–1:00; Inspire-others 1:00–1:15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Structure the Peula (Flow)

Description & Guidelines:
Chronological plan with prompts and instructions:
1) Opening Circle & Goals (0:00–0:10)
- Welcome, name circle. Prompt: "Share one leader you admire and one trait you value." (2–3 participants share quickly).
- Briefly outline four styles with simple examples:
  • Directive: Clear instructions when time is short/safety critical.
  • Participative: Group input to build buy-in.
  • Coaching/Servant: Help others grow; remove obstacles.
  • Delegative: Empower team to own the task.
- Set norms (listen, rotate roles, safety first) and explain that everyone will lead at least once.

2) Energizer: Leadership Switch Ball Jam (0:10–0:20)
- Setup: Circle with 2–3 sports balls. Music on medium.
- Round 1 (2 min): Leader A sets rule (e.g., underhand toss, say name before throw). Switch leader every minute, each changes one rule (e.g., add a clap, reverse direction, silent throws, faster tempo).
- Quick debrief (2 min): "What changed with each leader? Which style felt clear vs. chaotic?" Assign observers to note style cues.

3) Leadership Style Stations (0:20–0:40)
- Create 4 stations using craft/art supplies, rope to mark boundaries, and a ball at one station. Split into two subgroups if group is small; rotate every 5 minutes.
  Station A (Directive – Build to Specs): Using craft materials, build a small model (e.g., a 10 cm tall tower with a string flag) following a printed spec. Leader gives specific steps.
  Station B (Participative – Team Crest): Co-create a patrol crest using markers, paper, and glue. Leader collects ideas and facilitates a quick vote.
  Station C (Coaching – Skill Boost): With one ball, the team must achieve 20 consecutive clean passes. Leader offers technique tips, positive feedback, and adjusts difficulty.
  Station D (Delegative – Mini Campaign): Plan a simple poster and 30-second pitch to recruit for a community service action using available craft materials. Leader sets outcome, lets team own process.
- Mini debrief at each rotation: "Style used? Pros/cons?" Observers capture 1 insight per station.

4) Decision-Making Rope Challenge (0:40–1:00)
- Setup: Tie rope between two stable points to create a "spider web" with various openings marked by colored tape. Rules: No touching rope; each opening can be used once; 1 attempt per person per opening.
- Safety briefing: No lifts; use spotters; choose openings reachable by all. Alternative for accessibility: ground "river crossing" using rope as boundary lines and balls as scarce resources to ferry across.
- Task: Get the whole team through using a clear decision process. Rotate leader every 5 minutes: Leader 1 proposes a plan; Leader 2 runs the plan and adapts; Leader 3 handles setbacks and morale.
- Debrief (last 5 min): "What decision path worked? Where did responsibility show? How did leaders balance speed, safety, voice?"

5) Inspire Others: Role-Play + Commitment Flags (1:00–1:15)
- Give scenario cards (examples): "Storm forecast—change hike plan," "Conflict over tasks before event," "Volunteer turnout is low—rally the group." Each participant delivers a 45–60s motivating briefing using: Purpose, Plan, Care.
- Craft a small "Leadership Commitment Flag" (paper on string) with one actionable commitment (e.g., "I will delegate tasks with clear deadlines this week").

6) Reflection & Debrief (1:15–1:25)
- Use Head–Heart–Hands:
  Head: Which style fits which situation? How did decisions get made?
  Heart: When did you feel included or inspired?
  Hands: What will you do differently this week?
- Connect to Tzofim values (Dugma Ishit, Areivut). Invite 2–3 shares.

7) Closing & Next Step (1:25–1:30)
- One-word commitment round. Group photo with flags. Set a follow-up: next meeting starts with 5-minute check-in on commitments.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Keep transitions tight with music cues. Rotate leadership intentionally; ensure quieter teens get a turn. Use observers for real-time feedback to leaders. After each activity, tie insights back to the four styles and responsibility. Keep instructions concise; model the style you're asking them to try.

Time Structure:
Total 90 minutes: 0:00–0:10 Opening; 0:10–0:20 Energizer; 0:20–0:40 Stations; 0:40–1:00 Rope Challenge; 1:00–1:15 Inspire Others; 1:15–1:25 Reflection; 1:25–1:30 Closing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Time Management

Description & Guidelines:
Use visible time anchors and role-based pacing:
- Assign a timekeeper with a phone timer; give 2-minute and 30-second warnings.
- Music on/off signals transitions; a short track means rotate.
- Preprint station instructions to avoid long briefings.
- If behind schedule, cut one station rotation and keep the debrief.
Contingency for 60–75 minutes:
- Combine Stations into 3 rotations of 5 minutes (choose A, B, D).
- Run a simplified rope challenge (river crossing on ground) for 10–12 minutes.
- Keep Inspire Others to 10 minutes (shorter briefings).

Tzofim Best Practices:
Start on time; end on time. Protect the debrief—learning crystalizes there. Use clear hand signals and short prompts. Track who has led and ensure equity. Keep materials ready at stations to avoid delays.

Time Structure:
Explicit time cues inside each segment: 2-minute warnings at 0:18, 0:38, 0:58, 1:13, and 1:23. Contingency reductions noted if needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Materials & Logistics

Description & Guidelines:
Checklist:
- Outdoor space with two sturdy anchor points (tree/posts).
- Rope/string (15–20 m), masking/colored tape for marking openings.
- Sports balls (3–4, varied sizes).
- Art/craft supplies: A4 paper, card, markers, crayons, scissors, glue sticks, string, stickers.
- Station signs: A–D with style name and task.
- Music speaker + playlist (energizing tracks, volume safe for conversation).
- First aid kit, water, sunscreen.
Setup plan:
- Arrive early; tie spider web at chest height for most participants; ensure some low, wide openings for accessibility.
- Mark station areas with rope/string; place materials in labeled trays.
- Create scenario cards and printed specs for Station A.
Roles:
- Madrich/a 1: leads briefings, facilitates debriefs.
- Madrich/a 2: monitors safety, supports stations, manages music.
- Participant roles: leader, timekeeper, safety spotter, observer/feedback.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Keep materials minimal but purposeful; avoid clutter. Place water in shade nearby. Use durable rope knots and test tension. Assign setup to assistants or early-arriving participants to build ownership.

Time Structure:
Pre-session setup 20–30 minutes before start. In-session transitions: 1–2 minutes per rotation within allocated segments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Risk & Safety

Description & Guidelines:
Key risks:
- Rope challenge strain or falls.
- Running or erratic throws in energizer.
- Scissors/glue in craft stations.
Mitigation:
- No lifting people through web; use spotters; choose accessible openings.
- Clear rule: underhand throws, no sprinting; space out the circle.
- Scissors only at craft tables; supervise, store safely after use.
- Hydration and sun protection; pause if anyone feels unwell.
Emergency readiness: First aid kit onsite; know nearest clinic; have a phone.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Safety talk embedded at start of rope challenge. Encourage participants to speak up if uncomfortable. Model calm leadership and responsibility. Use the "buddy" system during physical tasks.

Time Structure:
Safety briefings within flow: Opening norms (0:06–0:08), Rope safety (0:40–0:42), Ongoing spotter checks during 0:42–1:00.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Delivery & Facilitation

Description & Guidelines:
Facilitation approach:
- Be a guide, not a lecturer. Demonstrate each style briefly, then let teens lead.
- Use feedback loops: observers offer one "plus" and one "next" after each leadership turn.
- Ask sharp questions that connect action to insight: "What did your style unlock? What did it close?"
- Keep energy balanced: music for movement, quiet voice for debrief.
- Inclusion: invite different forms of leadership (organization, empathy, clarity). Offer non-physical roles when needed.
Sample prompts:
- "Directive works best when…?"
- "How did participative leadership change commitment?"
- "What did the coaching leader do to build skill?"
- "When is delegating responsible vs. avoiding responsibility?"

Tzofim Best Practices:
Use names often. Validate effort before critiquing. Frame mistakes as data. Rotate leadership consciously to include all. Tie every insight back to Tzofim values and real tribe scenarios.

Time Structure:
Facilitator interventions are brief and timed: 1–2 minute instructions per activity, 2–3 minute debriefs as scheduled within the 90-minute flow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Reflection & Debrief

Description & Guidelines:
Structured reflection:
- Head–Heart–Hands circle: each participant shares one insight (Head), one feeling moment (Heart), and one action (Hands).
- Style fit: ask each participant to pick a scenario (from role-play cards) and name which style they would use and why.
- Commitment flags: invite volunteers to read their commitments; pair up for accountability.
Follow-up: Next meeting, begin with a 5-minute check on commitments and one success story.

Tzofim Best Practices:
Keep reflection grounded in observed behaviors. Use open questions, ensure every voice is heard. Encourage specificity in commitments (who/what/when). Link personal responsibility to group impact.

Time Structure:
1:15–1:25 reflection within the flow; 1:25–1:30 closing commitments and photo.
